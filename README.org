* Goals
  - Build prototype for a free play railbound style train game
* Idea
** class Tile
   Each tile will have 4 directions, NEWS. The Tile will also have a mapping that defines how the train will exit if it enters from a given entrance. E.g.
   
   ------
   ------
   
   Basic horizontal tile has the mapping E --> W, W --> E. When a direction does not exist as a key for this mapping, entry from that direction is not possible.
   
   More complex tiles can have weird mappings, e.g. 
   
   ----------
   ----\ \---
        \ \
	
   Will have mapping E -> S (because of the connection), W -> E (because it bypasses the connection), and S -> E
   
   With these rules it should be possible to simulate the movement of one or more agents atop these tiles.
